# Portfolio website
Welcome to my portfolio website where I show off my skills, projects, and anything else.
It's going to be my special place on the internet, accessible at mikolajstrusinski.com
I plan to add some cool looking css animations, and effects, interesting javascript techniques, and general showcasing of my programming abilites.
Initially I plan to have it as a simple CSR web app written in React using Vite as the bundler.
Perhaps in the future the site will offer some more advanced features like support for blogs, some user interaction etc, but for now, it will just be a simple static site.
